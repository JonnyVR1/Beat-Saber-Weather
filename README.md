# Installing effects
1. Download the effect you want to use.
   - These are located in the #finished-effects and #finished-effects-legacy channels of this Discord server: https://discord.gg/8pY6r3rjPm
   - For PC, effects must be in the .effect format

2. Locate the Weather effects folder.
   - For Steam, this is typically located at “C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\UserData\Weather\Effects”
   - The mod does not automatically create this folder.
   - If it does not exist, first create the “Weather” folder in the UserData folder.
   - Then create the “Effects” folder in the Weather folder.

3. Place the .effect file into the Effects folder.
   - If the effect also comes with a .dll file, place this into the Beat Saber Plugin folder. (No effects currently use a .dll file)
